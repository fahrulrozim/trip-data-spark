# trip-data-spark

This is a repository for assignment practice case Data Engineer Fellowship 7 by IYKRA. In this case, I'm trying to use pyspark to answer some question using `tlc trips data 2021`. You can get the data in this link : [Trips Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).

Pre-requisite:
1. Python 3.7 or later
2. Jupyter notebook
3. Pyspark

Note : if you haven't installed pyspark yet, you can check [my repo](https://github.com/fahrulrozim/pyspark).

Question that is solved:
1. How many taxi trips were there on February 15?
2. Find the longest trip for each day ?
3. Find Top 5 Most frequent `dispatching_base_num` ?
4. Find Top 5 Most common location pairs (`PUlocationID` and `DOlocationID`) ?
5. Write all of the result to BigQuery table (additional - point plus)

How to run:

Open `.ipynb` file using `Jupyter Notebook` and you'll see the result while running the code.
