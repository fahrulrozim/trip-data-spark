# trip-data-spark

This is a repository for assignment practice case Data Engineer Fellowship 7 by IYKRA. In this case, I'm trying to use pyspark to answer some question using `tlc trips data 2021`. You can get the data in this link : [Trips Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).

Pre-requisite:
1. Python 3.7 or later
2. Jupyter notebook
3. Pyspark

Note : if you haven't installed pyspark yet, you can check [my repo](https://github.com/fahrulrozim/pyspark).

How to run:
Open `.ipynb` file using `Jupyter Notebook` and you'll see the result while running the code.
